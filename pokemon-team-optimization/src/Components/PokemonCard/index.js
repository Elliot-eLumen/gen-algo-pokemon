          Bulbasaur is a small, quadrupedal Pok√©mon that has blue-green skin
          with darker patches. It has red eyes with white pupils, pointed,
          ear-like structures on top of its head, and a short, blunt snout with
          a wide mouth. A pair of small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper
          jaw when its mouth is open. Each of its thick legs ends with three
          sharp claws. On Bulbasaur's back is a green plant bulb, which is grown
          from a seed planted there at birth.
